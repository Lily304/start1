        The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles
        <br>(two of those being pony cars) produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge.<br>
         However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.<br>
        From model years 1970 to 1974,<br> the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop<br>
        and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.<br>
        The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe version of an economical compact car.<br>
        The third and current generation is a pony car
        <br>that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.<br>
